# penrosechange

1.The library we drew from was called Simulate: Penrose Tiles. https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Simulate:_penrose_tiles

2.We chose this library because it produced a detailed drawing that had many features that could be modified to fit a variety of concepts. We realized that were able to replicate the Star Wars light speed effect and changed the code from there.

3.The changes made to this project were as follows: The background on line 17 was changed to make it a bluish color; though ideally we would've liked a bit darker blue this is as close as we got to that. From line 90 we changed the starting position to be more of center, and then changing the "line" to be much larger and far reaching. Playing around further with the code, the "translate" function on line 106 changed the rate of change around the square field.

4.a.The first potential exhibit for this work would be to use the code as a form of visual art set to music in the form of a laser show. One potential place to show this would be in a planetarium setting or other dark show. b.The second would be to use the code as an AR experience where the user could simulate light speed on their phone. It could potentially be used like a filter on videos and photos.
